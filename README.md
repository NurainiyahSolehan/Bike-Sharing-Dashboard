# Bike Sharing Dashboard 

An interactive data dashboard built using **Streamlit** to analyze bike-sharing usage patterns.
This project explores how time, weather conditions, and working-day status influence bike rental demand through data visualization and exploratory data analysis.

---

## Project Objective
The objectives of this project are:
- To analyze trends in bike-sharing usage over time
- To examine the impact of weather conditions on bike rental demand
- To compare bike usage patterns between working days and non-working days
- To provide interactive visualizations that support data-driven insights

---

## Business Questions
This project aims to answer the following business questions:
- How does the bike-sharing usage trend change throughout the year (2011)?
- How does weather conditions (*weathersit*) affect bike rental demand?
- What is the comparison of bike rentals between working days and non-working days?

---

## Key Insights
- Bike rentals tend to increase during spring and summer, with a peak in the middle of the year, and decline during fall and winter.
- Weather conditions significantly affect bike rental demand. Clear weather results in the highest number of rentals, while rainy conditions cause a sharp decrease.
- Bike usage is generally higher on non-working days, indicating that many users utilize bike-sharing services for recreational purposes rather than daily commuting.
